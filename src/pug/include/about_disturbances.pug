h2 Experiments with disturbances

p
  | You can study the effects of disturbances at single nodes on the power grid. By clicking on a node, its phase φ and
  | frequency ω are perturbed by the values selected through the sliders on the left of the screen.
p
  | You can also apply the perturbance to all nodes with the button under the sliders.
p
  | Observe how the nodes change their colour/ size and how the links change their width proportional to the
  | phase/frequency and line loadings. Using such experiments, the CoNDyNet researchers attempt to answer questions
  | like:
ul
  li What is the probability to come back to a stable situation after a local perturbation?
  li What is the probability that all frequency deviations are strictly limited?
  li Can we use properties of the network structure to identify the most critical nodes in terms of the above questions?
